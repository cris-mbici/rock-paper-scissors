# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game  

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the player competes against an AI. The game starts with a welcome message and then enters a loop where the player selects between rock, paper, or scissors. The AI randomly chooses its move, and the results are displayed using both text and emojis.  

If the player enters an invalid choice or leaves the input blank, they are prompted to try again. The game determines the winner based on standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules, announcing whether the player wins, loses, or ties. After each round, the player is asked if they want to play again, and the game continues until they choose to exit.
